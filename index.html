                <P>Hi my name is Jason Vermaak. I am turning 25 this year and decided that I need to change up my life
                    for the better so I can have a more fulfulling future. From changing my career path to my a daily
                    life style and I want to mix everything up. I have been studing general business in school for 4
                    years and have have never felt happy. Stumbling around different programs around UCF I found a coding
                    bootcamp and once I read what it intailed I was all in. From website design to creating apps I loved
                    reading all the different and completive things I could be learning.
                </P>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Aside from this new career path playing sports and being active are key things that make me happy. I can talk and play basketball
                    every second of the day, football is a close second though. I was born in South Africa and moved
                    to the United States when I was 7 so I had to learn all the "American sports" alittle later than
                    all the other kids, this didn't stop me from wanting to be the best! Sports in South Africa were
                    very similar but very different from Rugby to cricket, field hockey and hand ball. I picked most
                    sports pretty quickly but to this day cannot hit a base ball to save my life.

                </P>
